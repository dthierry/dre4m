# Model

This section provides a shortcut description of the model behind `dre4m`. For
the purpose of laying out the core concepts, notation has been simplified from
the original paper.
The problem behind the diversification of the technology of a sector can be
summarized by the following linear program,

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \min\; O\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}\right):= 
        \alpha \, \mathtt{NPV} \left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}\right)
        + \beta \, \mathtt{termCost} \left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}\right)
        + \gamma \, \mathtt{softSl}\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}\right)
        + , \; \text{s.t.} \; \mathbf{x} \in
        \mathcal{X}(\mathbf{p}).
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

In which, $\mathbf{x}$ represents the concatenated vector of variables of the
problem, and $\mathbf{p}$ represents the exogenous parameters of the model, 
e.g., capital costs, demand, etc. $\mathcal{X}$ represents the feasible
set of constraints of the model, e.g. asset balance, and so forth. Finally, the
scalars $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$, are arbitrary scaling
factors.

## Objective function

The objective function has three main components, viz.,

| Term                                                    | Description            |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| $\mathtt{NPV} \left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}\right)$      | Net present value      |
| $\mathtt{termCost} \left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}\right)$ | Terminal cost          |
| $\mathtt{softSl}\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}\right)$    | Soft service-life cost. |

Net present value, is composed of the overnight capital, O&M, fuel, and
retirement costs, adjusted over time. Terminal cost compensates for the myopic
results, as a consequence the fixed horizon model. Finally, soft service-life is
methodology in which assets penalized for taking part in the system past their
typical service-life.

Next is a short description of the core component of the model, but it is noted
that this section will not reference to all of the equations and variables found
in the model. Refer to the manuscript for more details.

## Core: asset balance constraints

The main component of `dre4m` is the set of variables and constraints that
represent the changes to the technology asset makeup over time. 
Any case study for `dre4m` requires a set of *initial* assets. Then, for the
specified time horizon, the model within `dre4m` would find the appropriate set
of retirements, and retrofitting decisions for the existing assets. Moreover,
it can also decide to deploy new capacity from a technology portfolio. 

Having establishing the most relevant decisions of the model, the balance terms
are contingent upon the following sets, representing time, technology, and
initial age, viz.,

|Sets|Description|
|----|-----------|
|$T$|Time set ($\left\lbrace 0, 1, \dots, \mathtt{horizon}\right\rbrace$)|
|$I$|Technology set ($\left\lbrace \text{tech 0}, \text{tech 1}, \dots\right\rbrace$)|
|$N_j$|Initial age of existing asset set ($N_j \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$)|
|$K_i$|Sub-technology for existing assets|
|$\tilde{K}_i$|Sub-technology for new assets.|

The following variables ($\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$) are thus, recognized,

|variable     |description|
|-------------|-----------|
|$w^t_{i,j}$   |existing assets, $t \in T, i \in I, j \in N_i$|
|$y^t_{i,k,j}$ |retrofitted assets transition, $t \in T, i \in I, k \in K_i, j \in N_i$|
|$u^{t}_{i,j}$|retired assets $t \in T, i \in I, j \in N_i$|
|$z^t_{i,k,j}$|retrofitted assets, $t \in T, i \in I, k \in K_i, j \in N_i$|
|$\overline{u}^t_{i,k,j}$|retired retrofitted assets, $t \in T, i \in I, k \in K_i, j \in N_i$|
|$x^{t}_{i,k,j}$|new assets, $t,j \in T, i \in I, k \in \tilde{K}_i$|
|$v^t_{i,k,j}$|retired new assets, $t,j \in T, i \in I, k \in \tilde{K}_i$|
|$\tilde{x}^t_{i,k}$|new allocated, $t,j \in T, i \in I, k \in \tilde{K}_i$.|

### Existing

From a point in time to the next, existing assets can either be retired, undergo
a number of retrofits, and remain the same. This corresponds to the decision
tree, from the following figure.

<p class="aligncenter"> <img src="../img/wuy.svg" width="40%" height="40%"
title="balance for existing assets"> </p>

<style>
.aligncenter {
    text-align: center;
}
</style>

This can be interpreted as an algebraic expression as follows, 

$$
  w^{t+1}_{i,j} = w^{t}_{i,j} - u^{t}_{i,j} - \sum_{k \in K_i} y^{t}_{i, k,j}, 
  \; \forall t \in T, i \in I, j \in N_i.
$$

### Existing-retrofitted

If an asset is subject to retrofitting, i.e. at time $t$, for asset of kind $i$,
and base age $j$, $y^t_{i,k,j} > 0$ for some $k\in K_i$, said asset
enters a separate balance for retrofitted-assets. From that point, the
retrofitted-asset can either be retired or remain unchanged at the next point.
This is shown in the following picture.

<img src="../img/zyu.svg" width="40%" height="40%" title="balance for new 
assets">

Which results in the following algebraic expression,

$$
    z^{t+1}_{i,k,j} = z^{t}_{i,k,j} - \overline{u}^t_{i,k,j} + y^t_{i,k,j},\;
    \forall 
  t \in T, i \in I, k \in K_i, j \in N_i.
$$

### New-asset 

New assets are allocated strategically, i.e. at time $t$, for kind $i$, there is
$\tilde{x}^t_{i,k}>0$ for some $k \in \tilde{K}_i$. Then, these enter their own
tally following the next equation,

$$
    x^t_{i,k,t} = \tilde{x}^t_{i,k}, \; 
    \forall t\in T, i\in I, k\in \tilde{K}_i.
$$

Moreover, the new assets can either be retired, or continue to the next point,
this is laid out in the following figure and equation.

<img src="../img/xv.svg" width="40%" height="40%" title="balance for retrofits">


$$
    x^{t+1}_{i,k,j} = x^{t}_{i,k,j} - v^t_{i,k,j}
    ,\; \forall
    t,j \in T, i \in I, k \in \tilde{K}_i.
$$


### Supporting constraints

Following the supposition of an initial amount of existing assets of different
kinds, the variables are linked by the following equation,

$$
    w^0_{i,j} = \mathtt{initCap}_{i,j}, \; \forall i\in I, j\in N_i.
$$

Also, it is assumed that no retrofitted-assets exists at the initial time.

$$
    z^0_{i,k,j} = 0, \; \forall i\in I, k \in K_i, j\in N_i.
$$

## Concluding remarks

It is encouraged to refer to the `dre4m` manuscript where the complete model is
laid out. This page is a brief summary of some core aspects of the model.
